## What It Is

The [OpenBar build system][openbar] is used to level up other project
usability, reproducibility and sustainability.

It was designed to wrap Yocto projects, but it turns out that it can be
extended to any other project.

The [OpenBar wizard][wizard] allows such projects to be set up in no time
at all.

## Features

* Simple `Makefile` interface with defconfig files.

* Containerized project environment using `docker`.

* Low host requirements.

* Online setup wizard.
